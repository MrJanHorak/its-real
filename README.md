# Climate change. It's Real.

This is an app I am working on to learn how to use Mapbox. 
The idea for this app came while taking part of an international aid themed hackathon from General Assembly.

My team was tasked to create a climate focused app. During out ideation process we came up with the idea of an app that allows a user to show the effects of global climate change. 

In the weeks that followed a few more ideas have come up and I will probably come up with a few more ideas as I begin the process of planning this app.

## For not the MVP goals are: 

* Use of a map
* Create markers 
* Upload 2 photos for before and after view
* When a marker on the map is selected have a popup display both pictures with a curtain view.

## Stretch goals:

* Have green markers for positive change 
* Have red markers for negative change
* Add forum/blog like CRUD on post of pictures to have users share stories for each pic
* Allow other users to comment on pics
* Landing page view that shows most recent posts
* Explore mode to allow global browsing of the map

## (planned) Resources:
* [Mapbox](mapbox.com) Map source.
* [React-Map-GL](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/) Makes using Mapbox GL in React applications easy.
* [react-compare-image](https://github.com/junkboy0315/react-compare-image) Planning on using this for the direct image comparison. 
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/) For photo upload.
